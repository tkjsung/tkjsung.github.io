## Course Project

**Project Title: Comparison of Different Machine Learning Algorithms with Sentiment Analysis**

The main course work in this course is the course project, which is a self-defined project. In this course, my partner and I chose to compare different modern machine learning algorithms in the field of natural language processing.

### Project Abstract

A comparison of different machine learning algorithms for sentence-level sentiment analysis problem on a Kaggle dataset was performed. Sentiment analysis (SA) is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has been widely used in everyoneâ€™s daily lives, ranging from brand watch to social media monitoring. Thus, a model with high accuracy of SA has many important practical applications. In this report, several SA models are tested, including traditional non-neural network-based method and neural-network based methods. In particular, the traditional method that was examined was support vector machine (SVM) and the neural network-based methods include convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). The test results from these networks show that performance is limited with neural network models. It was also found that while CNN is good for computer vision applications, it is not good for sentiment analysis. Lastly, for complex models like BERT, a large amount of training time and resources are required to achieve the best performance.
