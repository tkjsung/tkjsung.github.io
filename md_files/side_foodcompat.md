* * *

## Side Project Work Repository

Written in Python. Uses the pandas and tkinter python libraries.

## About the Side Project

Certain foods, when eaten together, may cause ill effects on our bodies. This is why I own several books on whether certain combinations of foods are compatible with each other. Some are good and have great health benefits, while others are not. Since I often search in a book about if certain foods can be eaten together, I thought that I could make it the process simpler by creating an offline search engine. This way, I can having a database of all the data for ease of search (no flipping through books!).

The code works by converting XLSX file (with my food compatibility database) into a CSV file. Then the Python library pandas is used to read the data into the Python script. Tkinter is chosen for the GUI interface since it is a Python default tool that will ensure cross-platform compatibility (as long as the relevant libraries are installed).

<!-- I compiled the compatibility data into an Excel document, used Python to convert the file into a CSV, then developed a GUI in Python that can read the CSV "database". I was thinking of deploying this on GitHub pages, but found that I chose the wrong programming language to do so. However, I learned a lot about how GUI is put together and how intricate it is to program it. Although this project didn't go as I have planned, I enjoyed exploring the different aspects of Python (as I am a beginner to Python at the time I started this project). -->
