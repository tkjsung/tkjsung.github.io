## Course Info

This course is about machine learning with an emphasis on artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning. Students will have the opportunity to build a working AI that is able to adapt and learn through interactions with its environment. By the end of the course, students will understand and appreciate how reinforcement learning combined with with neural nets can be used to build powerful AI agents.

The course is very practical in nature and requires completion of 3 separate pieces of coursework written in Java.
