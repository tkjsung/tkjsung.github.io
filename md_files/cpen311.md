# CPEN 311: Digital Systems Design

* * *

## Course Laboratory Work

Available at: <a href="https://github.com/tkjsung/CPEN311" target="_blank">https://github.com/tkjsung/CPEN311</a>

In CPEN 311, laboratory sessions required the use of Altera’s DE1-SoC FPGA board. In the laboratory sessions, hardware description language SystemVerilog was used to enable certain features on or using the DE1-SoC FPGA board.

There were a total of five laboratory assessment items. Each subsequent lab uses concepts from earlier labs (e.g., If Finite State Machine (FSM) is first used in lab 2, lab 3 onwards would also use the concept).
* Lab 1: Tone Organ
	* Focus: Basic Verilog
* Lab 2: Simple iPod.
	* Focus: Finite State Machines (FSM), Flash Memory, PS2 Keyboard
* Lab 3: Simple iPod with Strength Meter
	* Focus: Assembly Language
* Lab 4: RC4 Decryption
	* Focus: Memory, Scheduling, and Decryption
* Lab 5: VGA Oscilloscope
	* Focus: Hardware/Software Interface (uses NIOS processor on DE1-SoC FPGA and Quartus II’s Qsys System Integration Tool GUI), Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS), Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), Modulations, Clock Domains, Audio, and VGA


<!-- Hardware Description Language used is SystemVerilog.

Please note that the repository may be privated during certain times of the year (usually September to December) so current students cannot use this to fulfill laboratory assessments.

## Course Info

CPEN 311 is a course on advanced combination and sequential electronic system design, which involves the use of computer hardware. Hardware specifications, modeling, and simulation are done using hardware description languages (HDL) and CAD tools. Hardware designs written using HDL or designed using CAD tools are implemented with programmable logic on FPGAs. Applications include complex state machines, microcontrollers, arithmetic circuits, and interface units.
