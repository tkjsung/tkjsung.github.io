##  About the Side Project

Certain foods, when eaten together, may cause ill effects on our bodies over time. This is why I own several books on whether certain combinations of foods are compatible with each other. Some are good and have great health benefits, while others are not. Since I often search in a book about if certain foods can be eaten together, I thought that I could make it the process simpler by creating a custom search engine. This way, I can having a database of all the data for ease of search (no flipping through books!).

## Other Information

* This project is similar to [the Python project here](/md_files/side_foodcompat_gui). Python apps cannot run in a browser, which is inconvenient when searching on mobile devices.
* The website meets the minimum feature set that I wanted to develop, which is the ability to search food items and get food compatibility results. Anything else, such as styling or efficient coding, is secondary and may be improved over time as I only know basic HTML syntax and do not have web development experience.
* The food compatibility website is hosted on the same GitHub repository as this one. As such, limitations of GitHub Pages apply.
    * GitHub Pages only support static pages; **Client-side processing only**
