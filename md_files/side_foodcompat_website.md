# Side Project: Food Compatibility Website

* * *

**THIS PROJECT IS ONGOING. PAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.**

This project is similar to [the Python project here](/md_files/side_foodcompat_gui). Python apps cannot run in a browser, which is inconvenient for this particular project where searching is necessary to see which foods are compatible with one another.

## About the Side Project

Certain foods, when eaten together, may cause ill effects on our bodies. This is why I own several books on whether certain combinations of foods are compatible with each other. Some are good and have great health benefits, while others are not. Since I often search in a book about if certain foods can be eaten together, I thought that I could make it the process simpler by creating an offline search engine. This way, I can having a database of all the data for ease of search (no flipping through books!).

The code works by converting XLSX file (with my food compatibility database) into a CSV file. Then the Python library pandas is used to read the data into the Python script. Tkinter is chosen for the GUI interface since it is a Python default tool that will ensure cross-platform compatibility (as long as the relevant libraries are installed). -->
